/// Your intent when writing a file to some path. This is used to determine what
/// constitutes a conflict and what the autorename strategy is. In some

/// the target path contains a folder, it's always a conflict. (c) If the target
/// path contains a file with identical contents, nothing gets written; no
/// conflict. The conflict checking differs in the case where there's a file at
/// the target path with contents different from the contents you're trying to
/// write.
